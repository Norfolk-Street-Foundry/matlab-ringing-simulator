GSiril is an example of a row source for the simulator. GSiril is distributed under the terms of the GPL or GNU [General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). From a non-programmer's point of view, this simply means it can be downloaded freely and without paying. However, the GPL is not really about price: it's about [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
